## Best Water Temperature for Catching Crayfish?

| Temp Range       | Activity Level |
|------------------|----------------|
| **55–70°F (13–21°C)** | **Most active** — foraging in shallows |
| **60–65°F (15–18°C)** | **Optimal** — best trap success |
| **<50°F (10°C)** | Dormant — poor results |
| **>75°F (24°C)** | Move to deeper/cooler water |

> **Pro Tip:** Use chicken livers, fish scraps, or hot dogs. Set traps at **dawn/dusk** in **1–3 ft** of rocky/muddy water.
