| :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Louisiana Crawfish   | Must be rinsed until clean.                                                                   |
| Water                | Fill pot to about **three or four holes**.                                                    |
| Seasoning            | Use about **half a bag** initially, then the **rest of the bag** later.                       |
| Lemons               | Cut in half; use about **five** initially, then the rest later.                               |
| Potatoes (Red)       | Cut in half; **do not peel** (the skin keeps them together).                                  |
| Sweet Potatoes       | Cut into similar size pieces as the red potatoes (they take longer to boil); **do not peel**. |
| Onions               | **Peel** and cut in half.                                                                     |
| Garlic               | Cut the tops off so the seasoning can get inside.                                             |
| Sausage and Hot Dogs |                                                                                               |
| Corn (Frozen)        | Added at the very end to cool the water.                                                      |

### **Instructions**

#### **Step 1: Clean the Crawfish**

1.  Place the crawfish in a bucket and add fresh water. You do not need salt or other additives.
2.  Rinse the crawfish two or three times.
3.  Mix them up to clean the dirt and mud.
4.  Remove all the dead crawfish and any trash.
5.  Continue washing with fresh water until the water is **clear clear clear**, which may take about four or five times.

#### **Step 2: Prepare the Pot and Initial Seasoning**

1.  Fill the pot with water, reaching about **three or four holes**; the water does not need to be all the way up to the top.
    - _Note:_ The more water used, the more seasoning is required; the less water used, the less seasoning is needed.
2.  Crank up the fire to bring the water up to a boil.
3.  Once the water gets hot, add about **half a bag of seasoning**.
4.  Take about **five lemons**; you can either squeeze them or just throw them in the water.
5.  Wait until the seasoned water smells "real good" and you've got your neighbors "mad at you".

#### **Step 3: Boil the Fixings**

1.  Add the first batch of fixings: the **potatoes, onions, and garlic**.
2.  Once the water reaches a **rolling boil**, allow the fixings to cook for **10 minutes**, then start checking them to see if they are tender.
3.  Once the potatoes, onions, and garlic have been cooking for about 10 minutes and start getting tender, add the **sausage and hot dogs**.
4.  Once the vegetables are done boiling, take them out and put them to the side.

#### **Step 4: Prepare for Crawfish**

1.  Add a little bit more seasoning into the water (the rest of the bag that was used initially).
2.  Throw in the rest of your lemons.
3.  Bring the water back up to a **rolling boil**.

#### **Step 5: Boil the Crawfish**

1.  Add the crawfish.
2.  Let the water come back up to a rolling boil.
3.  Allow the crawfish to **boil for 5 minutes** at a rolling boil.
    - _Note:_ This specific 5-minute timing was used because it was early season and the crawfish were "real real soft".

#### **Step 6: Soak and Finish**

1.  After the crawfish boiling time is complete, add the **frozen corn**.
    - _Note:_ You should wait until last to add the corn because it cools the water down and stops the boiling process.
2.  Let the mixture **soak for 20 minutes**.
3.  After the 20 minutes, pop the head of the crawfish; that's how you know they are cooked.
