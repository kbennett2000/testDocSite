## FAQ

### What are the rules for fishing for crawdads in Colorado?

#### Rules for Fishing for Crawdads (Crayfish) in Colorado

- Rules apply statewide unless overridden by local or special regulations (e.g., no traps in Aurora Reservoir).
- A valid fishing license is required for anyone 16 or older (~$36 annual resident; purchase at cpw.state.co.us).
  - Youth under 16 fish free but need supervision.

##### Methods

- Crayfish may be taken by hand, baited lines, traps, pots, nets, or seines for food or bait.
- Cage or box traps (including set pots) are allowed and must be tagged with your CPW Customer Identification Number (CID) or name/address.
  - Traps must allow non-target escape (e.g., via openings).
- Seines must be ¼-inch or smaller nonmetallic square mesh, max 20 ft long x 4 ft deep.
- Prohibited: Firearms, gigs, poisons, or methods that harm non-targets.

##### Seasons

- Year-round, no closed season statewide.

##### Limits

- Unlimited daily bag and possession limit.

##### Possession

- East of the Continental Divide: Only virile, waternymph, calico, ringed, and Southern Plains crayfish may be possessed.
- West of the Divide: All caught crayfish must be immediately killed (separate abdomen from cephalothorax) or returned unharmed.
- On either side: Freshwater shrimp, commercial brine shrimp, and krill are allowed; all other species prohibited.
- Commercial minimum size: 3 inches (tip of acumen to telson); return egg-bearing females immediately.
- Red swamp crayfish: Legal to import, transport, and possess live for human consumption (since Jan. 1, 2024), but possession limited to 72 hours max with importation license/receipt.
  - No release or use as bait.

##### Special Rules

- Don't release unused bait crayfish alive—dispose properly to prevent invasives.
- At Sanchez Reservoir State Wildlife Area: No live crayfish transport due to rusty crayfish presence.
- Report invasives (e.g., rusty crayfish) to CPW (email invasive.species@state.co.us or call 303-291-7295).
- Clean/drain/dry gear to avoid spreading aquatic nuisance species (ANS).

##### Bait Usage

- Crayfish can be used as bait where permitted, but no chumming.
- Live crayfish as bait:
  - East of Divide and below 7,000 ft—use only in the same water body (no transport/storage except in specific southeast counties).
  - Prohibited west of Divide (except Navajo Reservoir and certain rivers/lakes).
- Throw unused bait on land, not water.

### Is there any limit on the size of the trap?

- There is no statewide limit on the size of cage or box traps (including set pots) used for taking crayfish in Colorado, as long as they are designed to allow non-target species to escape (e.g., via appropriate openings).
- Seines (a type of net) are limited to ¼-inch or smaller nonmetallic square mesh, max 20 feet long x 4 feet deep, but traps have no such dimensions specified.
- Always label traps with your CPW Customer Identification Number (CID) or name/address, and check them daily.
- Local rules (e.g., in city parks) may prohibit traps entirely—confirm via CPW's 2025 Fishing Brochure.

### What water temperature is best for catching crayfish?

- Crayfish become most active and easier to catch when water temperatures are in the 55–70°F (13–21°C) range, with optimal conditions around 60–65°F (15–18°C).
- At these temps, they emerge from burrows, forage more aggressively in shallows (1–3 ft), and respond well to baits like chicken or fish scraps. - Below 50°F (10°C), activity slows dramatically (they hibernate or hide), requiring longer soaks or less success; above 75°F (24°C), they may retreat to deeper/cooler water, though some species tolerate up to 80°F (27°C) in warmer regions like Louisiana.
- In Colorado's reservoirs (e.g., Eleven Mile or Chatfield, ~60–70°F in September), aim for dawn/dusk in rocky/muddy shallows during spring–fall when temps hit this sweet spot. Monitor with a thermometer or app for best results.

### How long can I keep crawfish in a tank with an aerator?

- For short-term storage (e.g., before eating), a cooler with aerator can work for up to a week in cool, shady conditions.

### When is the best time of year to catch crawfish at Elevenmile Reservoir?

- The best time of year to catch crayfish at Eleven Mile Reservoir is late spring through early fall (April–October), when water temperatures rise above 55°F (13°C), making crayfish more active in rocky/muddy shallows.
- Prime season peaks in summer (June–August), with reports of excellent hauls during this period due to warmer water (~60–70°F/15–21°C) and increased foraging.
- Winter catches are possible but limited, as crayfish become dormant below 50°F (10°C).
- The statewide season is year-round with no bag limits, but target dawn/dusk for best results.
- Check current water temps via CPW's Fishing Atlas or park reports.

## Comprehensive Guide to Catching Wild Crawfish

Crawfish are crustaceans, related to shrimp, crab, and lobsters, and are often referred to as "freshwater lobsters". There are over 540 known species globally, with approximately 350 species found in the United States. The average adult crawfish typically grows up to about three inches long, but traps and techniques are designed to catch much larger specimens, some exceeding 10 or 12 inches with claws over four inches long.

### I. Location, Timing, and Investigation

Successful crawfishing requires identifying optimal habitats and timing.

#### A. Finding Prime Habitats (The "Crawfish Investigator")

Crawfish can be found across the country, even in surprising locations such as the Arizona desert.

1.  **Rivers and Creeks:** Focus on **slower moving water, eddies, or areas around islands**. Traps are generally dropped about 15 feet away from the shoreline.
2.  **Lakes and Reservoirs:** Look for ravines where water runs into the reservoir. The best spots often feature **rocky areas and muddy areas situated right next to each other**, as crawfish hide in the rocks and burrow in the mud. Small coves that contain rocks or eddies are also good targets.
3.  **Shoreline Evidence:** Look for evidence of crawfish everywhere, such as **shells, legs, and claws found along the shore**. Finding such evidence with no human footprints suggests a good, unfished spot.
4.  **Information Gathering:** Be a "crawfish investigator". Contact your local **Fish and Game department**, sporting goods stores, or bait shops. Look for mounds where moles have done their work. If a spot consistently yields only small crawfish, move to a new location.

#### B. Optimal Timing

Crawfish can live up to 20 years and keep growing, similar to how lobsters can live up to 100 years.

- **Seasonality:** The **mid-season** is considered the optimal time for catching huge crawfish. If fishing too early (e.g., April) yields nothing, they may not be in season. Crawfish may hibernate if water temperatures drop below about 58 degrees. However, successful crawfishing has occurred as late as mid-November in warmer rivers.
- **Time of Day:** While night is generally best because crawfish are more active, the urban legend that they can only be caught at night is false. Modern traps with the right color design allow for successful daytime catching.

### II. Bait Selection and Preparation

Crawfish are surprisingly picky eaters and prefer fresh food.

#### A. Recommended Baits

The consensus is that **fresh, oily, non-predatory fish works the best**. Crawfish eat mostly vegetation, but consume oily fish for fat and nutrients to strengthen their shells, especially before winter.

- **Top Choices:** **Trout, salmon, tilapia, and herring** are highly recommended. Tilapia is often cited as inexpensive and effective. Coconut is also effective.
- **Alternatives (If Fresh Fish is Restricted):** If local laws prevent the use of fresh fish (e.g., Nevada), alternative baits include **fish eggs crushed into a sponge** or **chicken livers**.

#### B. Baits to Avoid (Urban Legends)

Avoid popular but ineffective baits often suggested online:

- **Junk Food:** Hot dogs, bacon, canned cat food, and dry dog food should be avoided if aiming for large catches. (Note: Testing showed bacon yielded 11 crawfish compared to 8 for hot dogs, but both were far inferior to trout scraps).
- **Predatory Fish:** Do not use predatory fish like **pike, catfish, or bass**. Crawfish sense their natural predators and will move away from the trap.

#### C. Bait Preparation

Proper preparation maximizes the bait's efficacy:

- **Exposure:** Use fish with the skin on, as the skin helps release oils. Cut straight through the head to include the **gills**, which are attractive to crawfish. Run a knife down the meat to expose the inside, allowing oils to permeate the water. Cut the bait into small slices.
- **Freshness:** Crawfish prefer the freshest possible fish; **do not rot the fish** before use.

### III. Equipment and Trapping Techniques

Using purpose-built gear is crucial for catching large numbers of wild crawfish quickly.

#### A. Trap Design and Features

Effective traps should be engineered to address common issues found in cheaper models.

- **Entry and Size:** Traps must be designed so that **large crawfish can easily enter**. If trying to catch the largest crawfish, ensure the trap throat size is sufficient, as a 12-inch crawfish cannot fit through a two-inch hole.
- **Color:** Use a color that does not scare crawfish, such as **tan**, which blends with the bottom terrain and allows for successful daytime fishing. Avoid black traps, which scare crawfish away.
- **Bait Protection:** High-quality traps feature a **central bait cage** to prevent crawfish from eating the bait from the outside—they must enter the trap.
- **Capacity and Durability:** Look for high-capacity traps. Serious crawfishermen use durable gear, often equipped with **strong line** (e.g., 550-pound paracord). A high-capacity "Bigfoot trap" (2 ft long and 1 ft across) is available, but regulations must be checked.

#### B. Setting and Soaking Traps

Traps can be productive quickly, maximizing fishing time.

- **Short Soaks:** With modern, effective traps, significant catches can be made in as little as **30 to 60 minutes of soaking time**.
- **Overnight Soaks:** Leaving traps out overnight is common, but increases the risk of theft.
- **Alternative Methods:** Crawfish can also be caught by **snorkeling**, **hand lining** with bait, or **"picking"** them out of rocks and boulders along the shore at night using a flashlight.

### IV. Trap Security and Legal Compliance

Protecting valuable equipment and adhering to laws are crucial aspects of crawfishing.

#### A. Preventing Trap Theft ("Cage Pirates")

To protect equipment from being stolen:

- **Concealment:** Avoid setting traps in public fishing holes. **Hide the rope** under bushes or rocks. Use camouflaged rope instead of white or red.
- **Submerged Buoys:** Use a buoy that floats **below the water's surface**, running a line to a hidden spot on the shore.
- **Fast Fishing:** The most secure technique is relying on highly efficient traps for short soaks (e.g., one hour) so you don't have to leave the gear unattended overnight.

#### B. Regulatory Compliance

Always perform due diligence regarding regulations:

- **Check Laws:** Verify state and local laws regarding legal bait, trap size, and bag limits.
- **Tagging:** In some areas, tagging traps with your name and phone number is legally required. Tagging is also beneficial because if an expensive trap is lost, someone who finds it might call you to return it.
- **Invasive Species:** Crawfish are often considered non-native invasive species. Game and Fish agencies often request that fishermen remove as many as possible and **not return any to the water**. Catching and eating them is considered the best way to combat invasive species.

### V. Handling and Preparation for Consumption

Proper handling ensures the catch remains fresh and ready for cooking.

#### A. Transporting Live Crawfish

Crawfish must be fresh and alive for cooking; **do not eat dead crawfish**.

- **Coolers:** A cooler can be used without water for a couple of hours, though heat is a concern. If water is added, crawfish need oxygen (an aerator or "bubble box") to prevent them from drowning.
- **Keeping Fresh:** A large trap without doors (a "creature holder") can be submerged in the water to keep the caught crawfish fresh for a day or two while camping.

#### B. Purging (Cleaning)

The necessity of purging depends on the source water.

- **Salt Myth:** The urban legend of purging with salt is ineffective for cleaning entrails. Salt causes the crawfish to vomit (leading to murky water), not truly clean them.
- **Recommended Method:** If you must purge, place them in a cooler and refresh the clean water regularly. Many successful fishermen consider purging unnecessary and simply avoid eating the digestive tract (entrails).

#### C. Cooking the Catch

Crawfish can be transported anywhere once cooked. They can be boiled on a portable cooker at the lakeshore.

- **Boiling Method:** Use a boil mix (like Creole seasoning), fresh lemon, corn, and sausage (such as andouille sausage). Boil for about five minutes. Transfer them to a cooler, add Creole seasoning, seal the lid, and let them **steam for about ten minutes** to absorb flavor. Squeeze lemon juice over the final dish.
- **Storing Frozen Cooked Crawfish:** Cooked crawfish can be frozen. They can be stored whole in gallon bags or shelled meat can be stored in smaller bags with Creole seasoning. **Do not reboil frozen crawfish** as it makes the meat tough. Instead, reconstitute them by soaking them in hot tap water for about ten minutes, dumping the cold water, and repeating the soak.

#### D. Shelling Techniques

Shelling techniques can extract the meat quickly:

- **Tail Meat:** To extract the tail meat smoothly, press the **first rung down** from the head, pull the tail, and then pinch the end to extract the meat.
- **Claw Meat:** Break the claw off, pull the pincher off, and then use a fork (or a dull pointed object) to scoop the meat out from the backside. On really big crawfish, meat can also be extracted from the knuckle joint.

### **Instructions**

#### **Step 1: Clean the Crawfish**

1.  Place the crawfish in a bucket and add fresh water. You do not need salt or other additives.
2.  Rinse the crawfish two or three times.
3.  Mix them up to clean the dirt and mud.
4.  Remove all the dead crawfish and any trash.
5.  Continue washing with fresh water until the water is **clear clear clear**, which may take about four or five times.

#### **Step 2: Prepare the Pot and Initial Seasoning**

1.  Fill the pot with water, reaching about **three or four holes**; the water does not need to be all the way up to the top.
    - _Note:_ The more water used, the more seasoning is required; the less water used, the less seasoning is needed.
2.  Crank up the fire to bring the water up to a boil.
3.  Once the water gets hot, add about **half a bag of seasoning**.
4.  Take about **five lemons**; you can either squeeze them or just throw them in the water.
5.  Wait until the seasoned water smells "real good" and you've got your neighbors "mad at you".

#### **Step 3: Boil the Fixings**

1.  Add the first batch of fixings: the **potatoes, onions, and garlic**.
2.  Once the water reaches a **rolling boil**, allow the fixings to cook for **10 minutes**, then start checking them to see if they are tender.
3.  Once the potatoes, onions, and garlic have been cooking for about 10 minutes and start getting tender, add the **sausage and hot dogs**.
4.  Once the vegetables are done boiling, take them out and put them to the side.

#### **Step 4: Prepare for Crawfish**

1.  Add a little bit more seasoning into the water (the rest of the bag that was used initially).
2.  Throw in the rest of your lemons.
3.  Bring the water back up to a **rolling boil**.

#### **Step 5: Boil the Crawfish**

1.  Add the crawfish.
2.  Let the water come back up to a rolling boil.
3.  Allow the crawfish to **boil for 5 minutes** at a rolling boil.
    - _Note:_ This specific 5-minute timing was used because it was early season and the crawfish were "real real soft".

#### **Step 6: Soak and Finish**

1.  After the crawfish boiling time is complete, add the **frozen corn**.
    - _Note:_ You should wait until last to add the corn because it cools the water down and stops the boiling process.
2.  Let the mixture **soak for 20 minutes**.
3.  After the 20 minutes, pop the head of the crawfish; that's how you know they are cooked.
