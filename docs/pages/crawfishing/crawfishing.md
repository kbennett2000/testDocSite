## FAQ

### What are the rules for fishing for crawdads in Colorado?

#### Rules for Fishing for Crawdads (Crayfish) in Colorado

- Rules apply statewide unless overridden by local or special regulations (e.g., no traps in Aurora Reservoir).
- A valid fishing license is required for anyone 16 or older (~$36 annual resident; purchase at cpw.state.co.us).
  - Youth under 16 fish free but need supervision.

##### Methods

- Crayfish may be taken by hand, baited lines, traps, pots, nets, or seines for food or bait.
- Cage or box traps (including set pots) are allowed and must be tagged with your CPW Customer Identification Number (CID) or name/address.
  - Traps must allow non-target escape (e.g., via openings).
- Seines must be ¼-inch or smaller nonmetallic square mesh, max 20 ft long x 4 ft deep.
- Prohibited: Firearms, gigs, poisons, or methods that harm non-targets.

##### Seasons

- Year-round, no closed season statewide.

##### Limits

- Unlimited daily bag and possession limit.

##### Possession

- East of the Continental Divide: Only virile, waternymph, calico, ringed, and Southern Plains crayfish may be possessed.
- West of the Divide: All caught crayfish must be immediately killed (separate abdomen from cephalothorax) or returned unharmed.
- On either side: Freshwater shrimp, commercial brine shrimp, and krill are allowed; all other species prohibited.
- Commercial minimum size: 3 inches (tip of acumen to telson); return egg-bearing females immediately.
- Red swamp crayfish: Legal to import, transport, and possess live for human consumption (since Jan. 1, 2024), but possession limited to 72 hours max with importation license/receipt.
  - No release or use as bait.

##### Special Rules

- Don't release unused bait crayfish alive—dispose properly to prevent invasives.
- At Sanchez Reservoir State Wildlife Area: No live crayfish transport due to rusty crayfish presence.
- Report invasives (e.g., rusty crayfish) to CPW (email invasive.species@state.co.us or call 303-291-7295).
- Clean/drain/dry gear to avoid spreading aquatic nuisance species (ANS).

##### Bait Usage

- Crayfish can be used as bait where permitted, but no chumming.
- Live crayfish as bait:
  - East of Divide and below 7,000 ft—use only in the same water body (no transport/storage except in specific southeast counties).
  - Prohibited west of Divide (except Navajo Reservoir and certain rivers/lakes).
- Throw unused bait on land, not water.

### Is there any limit on the size of the trap?

- There is no statewide limit on the size of cage or box traps (including set pots) used for taking crayfish in Colorado, as long as they are designed to allow non-target species to escape (e.g., via appropriate openings).
- Seines (a type of net) are limited to ¼-inch or smaller nonmetallic square mesh, max 20 feet long x 4 feet deep, but traps have no such dimensions specified.
- Always label traps with your CPW Customer Identification Number (CID) or name/address, and check them daily.
- Local rules (e.g., in city parks) may prohibit traps entirely—confirm via CPW's 2025 Fishing Brochure.

### What water temperature is best for catching crayfish?

- Crayfish become most active and easier to catch when water temperatures are in the 55–70°F (13–21°C) range, with optimal conditions around 60–65°F (15–18°C).
- At these temps, they emerge from burrows, forage more aggressively in shallows (1–3 ft), and respond well to baits like chicken or fish scraps. - Below 50°F (10°C), activity slows dramatically (they hibernate or hide), requiring longer soaks or less success; above 75°F (24°C), they may retreat to deeper/cooler water, though some species tolerate up to 80°F (27°C) in warmer regions like Louisiana.
- In Colorado's reservoirs (e.g., Eleven Mile or Chatfield, ~60–70°F in September), aim for dawn/dusk in rocky/muddy shallows during spring–fall when temps hit this sweet spot. Monitor with a thermometer or app for best results.

### How long can I keep crawfish in a tank with an aerator?

- For short-term storage (e.g., before eating), a cooler with aerator can work for up to a week in cool, shady conditions.

### When is the best time of year to catch crawfish at Elevenmile Reservoir?

- The best time of year to catch crayfish at Eleven Mile Reservoir is late spring through early fall (April–October), when water temperatures rise above 55°F (13°C), making crayfish more active in rocky/muddy shallows.
- Prime season peaks in summer (June–August), with reports of excellent hauls during this period due to warmer water (~60–70°F/15–21°C) and increased foraging.
- Winter catches are possible but limited, as crayfish become dormant below 50°F (10°C).
- The statewide season is year-round with no bag limits, but target dawn/dusk for best results.
- Check current water temps via CPW's Fishing Atlas or park reports.

### **Instructions**

#### **Step 1: Clean the Crawfish**

1.  Place the crawfish in a bucket and add fresh water. You do not need salt or other additives.
2.  Rinse the crawfish two or three times.
3.  Mix them up to clean the dirt and mud.
4.  Remove all the dead crawfish and any trash.
5.  Continue washing with fresh water until the water is **clear clear clear**, which may take about four or five times.

#### **Step 2: Prepare the Pot and Initial Seasoning**

1.  Fill the pot with water, reaching about **three or four holes**; the water does not need to be all the way up to the top.
    - _Note:_ The more water used, the more seasoning is required; the less water used, the less seasoning is needed.
2.  Crank up the fire to bring the water up to a boil.
3.  Once the water gets hot, add about **half a bag of seasoning**.
4.  Take about **five lemons**; you can either squeeze them or just throw them in the water.
5.  Wait until the seasoned water smells "real good" and you've got your neighbors "mad at you".

#### **Step 3: Boil the Fixings**

1.  Add the first batch of fixings: the **potatoes, onions, and garlic**.
2.  Once the water reaches a **rolling boil**, allow the fixings to cook for **10 minutes**, then start checking them to see if they are tender.
3.  Once the potatoes, onions, and garlic have been cooking for about 10 minutes and start getting tender, add the **sausage and hot dogs**.
4.  Once the vegetables are done boiling, take them out and put them to the side.

#### **Step 4: Prepare for Crawfish**

1.  Add a little bit more seasoning into the water (the rest of the bag that was used initially).
2.  Throw in the rest of your lemons.
3.  Bring the water back up to a **rolling boil**.

#### **Step 5: Boil the Crawfish**

1.  Add the crawfish.
2.  Let the water come back up to a rolling boil.
3.  Allow the crawfish to **boil for 5 minutes** at a rolling boil.
    - _Note:_ This specific 5-minute timing was used because it was early season and the crawfish were "real real soft".

#### **Step 6: Soak and Finish**

1.  After the crawfish boiling time is complete, add the **frozen corn**.
    - _Note:_ You should wait until last to add the corn because it cools the water down and stops the boiling process.
2.  Let the mixture **soak for 20 minutes**.
3.  After the 20 minutes, pop the head of the crawfish; that's how you know they are cooked.
