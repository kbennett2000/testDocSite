# Yamabisi Clone List

## Overview
The majority of **Yamabisi** outboard motors are **clones of older Yamaha designs**, with high parts compatibility, similar specs (e.g., displacement, RPM ranges, and gear ratios). 

## Exceptions
The **only notable exception** is the **9.8HP model** (confirmed as a **Tohatsu clone**). The **9.9HP**, however, aligns with **Yamaha**.
